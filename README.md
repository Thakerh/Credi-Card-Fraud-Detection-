# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains code for a credit card fraud detection algorithm. This algorithm uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.6 or higher and the following packages installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- ploty

### Installing

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/thakerh/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

Run the code using the following command:

```
python fraud_detection.py
```

The output of the code should be the confusion matrix and accuracy of the model.

## Built With

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Package for scientific computing with Python
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Library
